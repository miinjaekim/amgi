# Backlog

Open work only, ordered by priority. Shipped, cancelled and decided items move to
[status.md](status.md) **with their reasoning**, so a closed call doesn't get
reopened from this file. Source of truth is the user's Google Tasks list; this is
the scoped version.

**Mobile shipping model: no OTA.** Iterate in Expo Go (`npx expo start`), cut a
production build when a batch is worth a release. Once one native module is in a
build, a second rides along free rather than costing a build of its own.

---

## Queued for the next build

**Nothing.** 1.3.0 (build 11) went out 2026-08-11 and was approved for external
testing on 08-12 — the six PRs it carried are shipped and have left this file for
the Shipped list in [status.md](status.md). The next mobile change starts this
section over.

⚠️ **Verify on the binary before the next build goes out.** These are the oldest
open items in the project — never checked on any release, only in Expo Go — and
1.3.0 is the first build in enough hands to close them cheaply, from what testers
report rather than by hand:

- The native paths: pronunciation audio, CSV/Anki export, sharing, offline review
  across a force-kill and reconnect, account deletion against the production
  `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`, the review reminder firing *and then disappearing*
  once you review, and the writing-rewrite copy button (`expo-clipboard`, new in
  1.3.0).
- The three renders never seen on a device: #81's packs list without per-pack
  descriptions, #87's "showing results for…" row, #88's part-of-speech badge.
  Cosmetic risk only — spacing, fit, wrapping.

**Pre-flight, for next time:** smoke-test in Expo Go → verify the native-adjacent
things on the build itself → bump `version` in `app.json` **before** starting the
build, not after → rewrite What to Test in `docs/testflight-beta-info.md` and
re-check the rest of it → **`expo config --type introspect` if any native module
was added**, which is where an entitlement you didn't ask for shows up before a
cloud build finds it → submit (`ascAppId` is in `eas.json`) → paste the listing
copy into Test Information, **both ko and en localizations**.

_The version-bump ordering earned its place on 2026-08-11: the 1.3.0 build was
started against an `app.json` still reading 1.2.0, and had to be restarted. EAS
auto-increments the **build** number but never the version, so nothing catches
this for you._

_A version change means another Beta App Review. 1.3.0's external approval covers
1.3.0 — new external testers can be invited under it freely, but the next version
bump queues for review again, so it is worth batching rather than cutting builds
one feature at a time._

_The listing check earned its place on 2026-07-27: it still advertised five study
languages after Traditional Chinese made six, and said nothing about account
deletion — which Apple looks for under 5.1.1(v)._

## High

**Empty.** Both items — spellcheck on lookup (#87) and term archiving during
review (#86) — shipped 2026-08-10 and moved to [status.md](status.md). They were
promoted together on 2026-08-09 as the two cases where the app quietly does the
wrong thing rather than nothing, and they closed together for the same reason:
each was one shared function away from being right on both platforms.

**Nothing is starred**, and hasn't been since 2026-08-10. The next thing to pick
up comes from Medium below.

## Medium

- [ ] **Word learning surface — meet a word before it's due.** A new card is
      immediately due in *both* directions (`isDue` returns both when neither is
      tracked, `sm2.ts:23`), so a word goes from saved to graded review with no
      first encounter in between. This is the surface for that first encounter:
      see it, hear it, use it once, *then* let SM-2 have it.
      Open before building: whether this writes scheduling at all or is purely a
      presentation step; if it writes, it is an `sm2.ts` change and the ease
      ratchet warning in the grammar item applies here too.

- [ ] **Vocabulary packs — iterate beyond v1.** Shipped: TOEIC (133), hiragana +
      katakana, TOPIK 고급 (160), and the two military packs (220 + 254, #81),
      all one pre-authored kind.
      *Principles:* audience is not beginners; packs unlock domains, never
      "starter" anything; curated from real sources, not AI-generated; word lists
      need user approval before shipping.
      *Next:* **JLPT** is the obvious gap — Japanese has only the kana packs, so a
      learner past the scripts has nothing — then TOEFL. Swedish, French and
      Traditional Chinese have **no pack at all**. Section themes as `/cards`
      filters are now a third rung on the deck axis that shipped — a chip per
      section under the pack you picked — not a new control: a fourth group in
      mobile's filter sheet, a third chip row on web.
      **A new pack now needs backs drafted alongside its word list**, since no
      kind ships without them. Drafts live in `docs/packs/`.

- [ ] **Shared term cache** — a `terms` collection keyed by normalized term +
      language, so a word looked up once is free for everyone after.
      _Promoted from Needs clarification 2026-08-08: `docs/local-model.md` §8
      names it the cheapest useful first step, ahead of any model work._ It buys
      most of what "local" was wanted for — instant lookups, an offline story,
      near-zero marginal cost — with **no build, no native module and no quality
      risk**, and unlike on-device it works on web too. Copies
      `/api/pronounce`'s content-hash pattern, **including its lesson that a bad
      generation becomes permanent**, so decide the invalidation story before
      writing the first document. Produces the corpus any later fine-tune would
      need as a byproduct.

- [ ] **Precompute depth and examples for the packs** — ~600 model calls, an
      afternoon, one throwaway script. The hypothesis the local-model item
      carried all along ("pre-cached content for a pack may beat inference
      on-device"), and `docs/local-model.md` §8 confirms it holds. Best done
      *after* the term cache, which is where the results would live.

- [ ] **Offline term capture** — jot terms to look up later, queued locally and
      resolved on reconnect. No model needed, just a queue and a flush.

- [ ] **Grid view for cards** — denser scanning of a large deck. Nobody's blocked.

## Bigger bets

- [ ] **Conversation practice** — _needs design._ Transcription + per-participant
      feedback; MVP is end-of-conversation feedback on a recording. Same "here's
      what you meant to say" model as writing review.
      **Reuse `packages/core/src/writing.ts`**: `WritingFinding` and
      `WritingCardCandidate` deliberately say nothing about writing, because
      per-utterance feedback is the same job on a different capture. A parallel
      copy is the drift that put `reviewQueue`/`drill`/`reminders` in core.
      Now carries a third job: **spoken** grammar-pattern practice waits on this,
      since the app has no ASR at all and solving capture twice is the same drift.
      Scope the three together.

- [ ] **Writing review: iterate past v1.** Nothing here blocks anyone.
      - A multi-sentence rewrite is handed to `PronounceButton` untested — far
        longer than that button has had, and Google TTS has length limits.
      - Card backs still occasionally arrive as two glosses where one would do.
        The rule permits two for necessity; the model reads it generously.
      - Findings aren't streamed — `/api/writing` is a single JSON call, so a long
        passage sits on a spinner. The upgrade is NDJSON-per-finding, exactly
        `examples-stream` + `parseStreamedExamples`.
      - `/api/writing` has no `try`/`catch`, so an outage or malformed response is
        a 500. `/api/explain` has the same exposure — fix together or not at all.

- [ ] **Should `/api/explain` allow two glosses too?** Surfaced 2026-07-31 by the
      writing-review rule. `/api/explain` still says "single best translation" in
      six prompt branches (12 templates). The reasoning that relaxed one applies,
      but changing the core lookup loop is a bigger blast radius than a new
      surface. Decide deliberately; if yes, all branches move together.

## Parked — generation features

Deprioritized 2026-07-24. Both generate word lists for a user who hasn't asked for
a specific word — a different, unproven job from the core loop.

- [ ] **Goal-based vocab lists: ambiguity + placement** — ambiguous terms are
      silently skipped (add a picker, or pass the goal to `/api/explain` as
      context); move generation out of the Import button. Decide placement first.
- [ ] **Card generation (goal-based)** — Learn has a coming-soon placeholder. Lean
      surface: goal input → checkboxes → one free-text refine field → save.
      `/api/vocab-list` already takes `previousWords` + `feedback`.

## Housekeeping — tooling that hides signal

`npm test` (200/200) and `npx eslint .` (0 errors) are green. What's left is what
those two now *show*.

- [ ] **13 React Compiler warnings, then turn the rules back up** —
      `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` (11) and `react-hooks/immutability` (2),
      and they're real: a `useEffect` calling `setState` synchronously renders
      twice on mount. Set to `warn` so landing the lint fix didn't mean landing 13
      rushed ones. Most want `useSyncExternalStore`, so each is a small design
      call, not a mechanical edit. Clear them, then delete the override —
      **don't silence them further**, which is the failure mode the override exists
      to avoid.
- [ ] **Five more warnings accumulated since** (total 18) and are *not* covered
      above: two dead bindings in `decks/[packId]/{page,drill/page}.tsx`, two
      `<img>` that should be `next/image` (`Header`, `SideNav`), one missing dep
      in `cards/page.tsx`.
- [ ] **Lint covers `apps/web` only** — core and mobile have no `lint` script, so
      `turbo lint` runs one package and reports success. Honest today, misleading
      the moment it gates CI. Mobile needs `eslint-config-expo`, core a small flat
      config. Do it with the CI gate, not before.

## Needs clarification

- [ ] **Personalised explanation preferences** — emphasis knobs (etymology,
      cultural context, example-heavy). Store in `users/{uid}`, include in prompt.
