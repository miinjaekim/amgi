# Amgi Scratchpad

Working notes for the project, split by topic so a single file can be pulled
into context without loading everything. Read only what the task needs.

| File | What's in it | Read it when |
|---|---|---|
| [vision.md](vision.md) | Product aspiration, design principles, audience, long-term direction | Making product calls |
| [ui-ux.md](ui-ux.md) | Palette, themes, navigation, copy/i18n, open design questions | Styling or laying out a surface |
| [tech-stack.md](tech-stack.md) | Web + mobile stack, deployment, CI, shared package layout | Setting up, adding a dependency, touching build/deploy |
| [data-model.md](data-model.md) | Flashcard discriminated union, Firestore collections, `STUDY_LANGUAGE_CONFIGS`, API shapes | Adding a language, changing card fields, touching API routes |
| [status.md](status.md) | What's shipped, what's in progress, known issues | Orienting at the start of a session |
| [backlog.md](backlog.md) | Prioritized backlog + unscoped ideas | Picking the next thing to build |
| [lessons.md](lessons.md) | Gotchas already paid for — Firestore, Expo monorepo, EAS, Next.js | Debugging something that smells familiar |

Related docs outside this folder:

- `docs/packs/toeic-pack-draft.md` — source draft for the TOEIC vocabulary pack
  (referenced from `packages/core/src/packs.ts`)
- `docs/testflight-beta-info-ko.md` — Korean TestFlight listing copy

**Convention:** when something ships, move it from `backlog.md` to the Shipped
list in `status.md` with the PR number and merge date. Durable gotchas go to
`lessons.md`, not into the shipped bullet.
