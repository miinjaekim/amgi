# Amgi Scratchpad

Working notes for the project, split by topic so a single file can be pulled
into context without loading everything. Read only what the task needs.

| File | What's in it | Read it when |
|---|---|---|
| [vision.md](vision.md) | Product aspiration, design principles, audience, long-term direction | Making product calls |
| [ui-ux.md](ui-ux.md) | Palette, themes, navigation, copy/i18n, open design questions | Styling or laying out a surface |
| [tech-stack.md](tech-stack.md) | Web + mobile stack, deployment, CI, shared package layout | Setting up, adding a dependency, touching build/deploy |
| [data-model.md](data-model.md) | Flashcard discriminated union, Firestore collections, `STUDY_LANGUAGE_CONFIGS`, API shapes | Adding a language, changing card fields, touching API routes |
| [status.md](status.md) | What's shipped, in progress, decided, known issues | Orienting at the start of a session |
| [backlog.md](backlog.md) | Open work only — prioritized, plus unscoped ideas | Picking the next thing to build |
| [lessons.md](lessons.md) | Gotchas already paid for — Firestore, Expo monorepo, EAS, Next.js | Debugging something that smells familiar |

**Convention:** `backlog.md` holds **only open work**. When something closes it
leaves that file:

- **Shipped** → the Shipped list in `status.md`, with PR number and merge date.
- **Decided or cancelled** → the Decisions section in `status.md`, *with the
  reasoning* — a closed call whose reasoning is lost gets reopened by whoever
  next notices the symptom.
- **Durable gotcha** → `lessons.md`, not the shipped bullet.

Backlog priority mirrors the user's Google Tasks list — `backlog.md` is the
scoped version of it.
